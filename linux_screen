Install Linux Screen
The screen package is pre-installed on most Linux distros nowadays. You can check if it is installed on your system by typing:

screen --version
Copy
Screen version 4.06.02 (GNU) 23-Oct-17
Copy
If you don’t have screen installed on your system, you can easily install it using the package manager of your distro.

Install Linux Screen on Ubuntu and Debian
sudo apt install screen
Copy
Install Linux Screen on CentOS and Fedora
sudo yum install screen
Copy
Starting Linux Screen
To start a screen session, simply type screen in your console:

screen
Copy
This will open a screen session, create a new window and start a shell in that window.

Now that you have opened a screen session you can get a list of commands by typing:

Ctrl+a ?

Starting Named Session
Named sessions are useful when you run multiple screen sessions. To create a named session, run the screen command with the following arguments:

screen -S session_name
Copy
It’s always a good idea to choose a descriptive session name.

Working with Linux Screen Windows
When you start a new screen session by default it creates a single window with a shell in it.

You can have multiple windows inside a Screen session.
To create a new window with shell type Ctrl+a c, the first available number from the range 0...9 will be assigned to it.

Bellow are some most common commands for managing Linux Screen Windows:

Ctrl+a c Create a new window (with shell)
Ctrl+a " List all window
Ctrl+a 0 Switch to window 0 (by number )
Ctrl+a A Rename the current window
Ctrl+a S Split current region horizontally into two regions
Ctrl+a | Split current region vertically into two regions
Ctrl+a tab Switch the input focus to the next region
Ctrl+a Ctrl+a Toggle between current and previous region
Ctrl+a Q Close all regions but the current one
Ctrl+a X Close the current region
Detach from Linux Screen Session
You can detach from the screen session at anytime by typing:

Ctrl+a d

The program running in the screen session will continue to run after you detach from the session.

Reattach to a Linux Screen
To resume your screen session use the following command:

screen -r
Copy
In case you have multiple screen sessions running on you machine you will need to append the screen session ID after the r switch.

To find the session ID list the current running screen sessions with:

screen -ls
Copy
There are screens on:
    10835.pts-0.linuxize-desktop   (Detached)
    10366.pts-0.linuxize-desktop   (Detached)
2 Sockets in /run/screens/S-linuxize.
Copy
If you want to restore screen 10835.pts-0, then type the following command:

screen -r 10835
Copy
Customize Linux Screen
When screen is started it reads its configuration parameters from /etc/screenrc and ~/.screenrc if the file is present. We can modify the default Screen settings according to our own preferences using the .screenrc file.

Here is a sample ~/.screenrc configuration with customized status line and few additional options:

~/.screenrc
# Turn off the welcome message
startup_message off

# Disable visual bell
vbell off

# Set scrollback buffer to 10000
defscrollback 10000

# Customize the status line
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{= kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B} %m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]'
Copy
